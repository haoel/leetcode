#
# There are two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively.
#
# Find the median of the two sorted arrays. The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)).
#
# Example 1:
# nums1 = [1, 3]
# nums2 = [2]
#
# The median is 2.0
# Example 2:
# nums1 = [1, 2]
# nums2 = [3, 4]
#
# The median is (2 + 3)/2 = 2.5
