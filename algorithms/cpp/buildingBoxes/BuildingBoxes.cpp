/***************************************************************************************************** 
 *
 * You have a cubic storeroom where the width, length, and height of the room are all equal to n 
 * units. You are asked to place n boxes in this room where each box is a cube of unit side length. 
 * There are however some rules to placing the boxes:
 * 
 * 	You can place the boxes anywhere on the floor.
 * 	If box x is placed on top of the box y, then each side of the four vertical sides of the 
 * box y must either be adjacent to another box or to a wall.
 * 
 * Given an integer n, return the minimum possible number of boxes touching the floor.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: n = 3
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: The figure above is for the placement of the three boxes.
 * These boxes are placed in the corner of the room, where the corner is on the left side.
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * Input: n = 4
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: The figure above is for the placement of the four boxes.
 * These boxes are placed in the corner of the room, where the corner is on the left side.
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * 
 * Input: n = 10
 * Output: 6
 * Explanation: The figure above is for the placement of the ten boxes.
 * These boxes are placed in the corner of the room, where the corner is on the back side.
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 	1 <= n <= 10^9

    At first, let's  build the perfect pyramid at the corner.

    we can find the following sequence:

        height    cubes
        1         1
        2         1 + 2 = 3
        3         1 + 2 + 3 = 6
        4         1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10
        5         1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15

    total(height) = total(height - 1) + sum( from 1 to height )
    
    sum ( from 1 to height) = (height * (height+1)) / 2
                            = height^2/2 + height/2
    So,
    
    total(height) =  (1+2+...+height)/2 + ( 1^2 + 2^2 +...+ height^2 ) / 2
    
    we know,  Î£n^2 = [n(n+1)(2n+1)]/6  (ref: https://brilliant.org/wiki/sum-of-n-n2-or-n3/)
    
    So, 
    
    total(height) = (height * (height+1)) / 4 + (height(height+1)(2height+1))/12
                  = height * (height + 1) * (height + 2) / 6
    

    for the rest cubes, we can place them like this

             (10) 
            (6) (9) 
          (3) (5) (8) 
        (1) (2) (4) (7) 
        
    sum ( for 1 to n ) = n(n+1)/2
