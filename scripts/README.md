Some Scripts
============

### comments.sh

`comments.sh` - it's used to generate author and problem description comments 

> **Notes**: 
> - The  `comments.sh`  needs [xidel](http://videlibri.sourceforge.net/xidel.html) to grab & parse the html  contents with filtering out the HTML tags. The script  would check the `xidel`  whether installed or not in your Linux box, if not, it will download the [Universal Linux Version](http://videlibri.sourceforge.net/xidel.html#downloads) . 
> - The `comments.sh` currently can automatically detect the problem's type, if the problem is `algorithm` type, it's going to create `.cpp` file, if the problem is `shell` type, the `.sh` file will be created.

1) Create a file named largestNumber.cpp, and add Copyright & Problem description
```
./comments.sh https://oj.leetcode.com/problems/largest-number/
```

2) Add Copyright & Problem description into existed file
```
./comments.sh https://oj.leetcode.com/problems/largest-number/ largestNumber.cpp
```

The comments would be generated by above examples as below:

/**********************************************************************************
 *
 * Given a list of non negative integers, arrange them such that they form the largest number.
 *
 * For example, given [3, 30, 34, 5, 9], the largest formed number is 9534330.
 *
 * Note: The result may be very large, so you need to return a string instead of an integer.
 *
 * Credits:Special thanks to @ts for adding this problem and creating all test cases.
