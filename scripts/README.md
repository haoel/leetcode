## workflow.sh

`workflow.sh` - it's used to run a number of operations. It depends on `comments.sh` and `readme.sh`

For example:
```
$ cd leetcode/algorithms/cpp
$ ../../scripts/workflow.sh https://leetcode.com/problems/design-authentication-manager/
Step 1 : Created "designAuthenticationManager" directory!
Step 2 : Created "designAuthenticationManager/DesignAuthenticationManager.cpp" source file!
Step 3 : Run "git add designAuthenticationManager/DesignAuthenticationManager.cpp"!
Step 4 : Edited the "designAuthenticationManagerDesignAuthenticationManager.cpp"!
Step 5 : Copied the readme text to Clipboard!
Step 6 : Edited the "README.md"!
Step 7 : You can commit the changes by running the following command line...

            git commit -am "New Problem Solution -\"Design Authentication Manager\""
```

## comments.sh

`comments.sh` - it's used to generate author and problem description comments 

> **Notes**: 
> - The  `comments.sh`  is compatible for both Linux and Mac platform.
> - The  `comments.sh`  needs [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) to grab & parse the json contents. 
> - The  `comments.sh`  currently can automatically detect the problem's type, if the problem is `algorithm` type, it's going to create `.cpp` file, if the problem is `shell` type, the `.sh` file will be created.

1. Create a file named largestNumber.cpp, and add Copyright & Problem description

    ```sh
    ./comments.sh https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-number/
    ```

2. Add Copyright & Problem description into existed file

    ```sh
    ./comments.sh https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-number/ largestNumber.cpp
    ```

The comments would be generated by above examples as below:

> **Notes**
> If you need to customize the `Author` name, you have to change the `$AUTHOR` variable at the beginning of the scripts.

```cpp

// Date   : 2015-01-25

/**********************************************************************************
 *
 * Given a list of non negative integers, arrange them such that they form the largest number.
 *
 * For example, given [3, 30, 34, 5, 9], the largest formed number is 9534330.
 *
 * Note: The result may be very large, so you need to return a string instead of an integer.
 *
 * Credits:Special thanks to @ts for adding this problem and creating all test cases.

## readme.sh

`readme.sh` - it's used to generate the table item in README.md

For example:

```sh
$  ./readme.sh ../algorithms/cpp/nextPermutation/nextPermutation.cpp 
|31|[Next Permutation](https://oj.leetcode.com/problems/next-permutation/) | [C++](./algorithms/cpp/nextPermutation/nextPermutation.cpp)|Medium|
```
