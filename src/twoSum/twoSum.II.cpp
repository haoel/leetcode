/********************************************************************************** 
* 
* Given an array of integers that is already sorted in ascending order, 
* find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.
* 
* The function twoSum should return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target, 
* where index1 must be less than index2. Please note that your returned answers (both index1 and index2) 
* are not zero-based.
* 
* You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.
* 
* Input: numbers={2, 7, 11, 15}, target=9
* Output: index1=1, index2=2 
*
